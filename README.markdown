# What.

A Chrome extension to blacklist JavaScript files from certain domains. The list of which domains to block is configurable and defaults to:

 *	[tynt.com][tynt] - Messes around with your clipboard
 *	[intellitxt.com][itxt] - Those double underlined words ad
 *	[snap.com][snap] - Makes every link a mine to step on

 [tynt]: http://www.tynt.com/
 [itxt]: http://www.intellitxt.com/
 [snap]: http://www.snap.com/

This extension is inspired by [Drew Thaler][thaler]'s [JavaScript Blacklist][jsbl] extension for Safari and borrows some code from it.
